"""Here between the quotes is written the documentation where i will explain the work in progress:
python unlike other languages (ex:java) does not need the variable to be declared by a type
the basic types are: 
int() ===> non decimal numbers like 1 5 9 10000 ... 
float() ===> decimal numbers like 2.3 7.1234 0.00045 ...
string() ===> everything considered to be a text that is between '' like 'Hi'  'Hello' 'John Doe' '25'
boolean() ===> two returns are possible either True or False

x = 5 #This is an int
